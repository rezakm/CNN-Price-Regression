# Price estimate regression based on house image with convolutional networks

 > Removing the fully-connected softmax classifier layer typically used for classification
> Replacing it with a fully-connected layer with a single node along with a linear activation function.
> Training the model with a continuous value prediction loss function such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, etc.

### This data set has been introduced and published in the 2016 article entitled 2016 House price estimation from visual and textual features.
